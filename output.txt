To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him men- tion her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and ﬁnely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who ﬁrst ﬁnds himself master of his own establishment, were sufﬁcient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the ﬁerce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been aban- doned as hopeless by the ofﬁcial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and ﬁnally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888 —I was returning from a journey to a patient(for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associ- ated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare ﬁgure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indi- cated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the ﬁre and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Wat- son, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.” “Seven!” I answered. “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a triﬂe more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.” “Then, how do you know?” “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?” “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.” He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, ner- vous hands together. “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the ﬁrelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost 3parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right foreﬁn- ger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.” I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am bafﬂed until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.” “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.” “Frequently.” “How often?” “Well, some hundreds of times.” “Then how many are there?” “How many? I don’t know.” “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my triﬂing experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.” The note was undated, and without either signa- ture or address. “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest mo- ment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an impor- tance which can hardly be exaggerated. This accountof you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.” “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it means?” “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to the- orize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?” I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my com- panion’s processes. “Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.” “Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.” I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P ,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper. “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes. “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his mono- gram, rather.” “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P ,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German- speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carls- bad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said. “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so un- courteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.” 4As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he con- tinued, glancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and ﬁfty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.” “I think that I had better go, Holmes.” “Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.” “But your client—” “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.” A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immedi- ately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. “Come in!” said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with ﬂame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which con- sisted of a single ﬂaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impres- sion of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally goodenough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?” “You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentle- man, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communi- cate with you alone.” I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.” The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by binding you both to abso- lute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an inﬂuence upon European history.” “I promise,” said Holmes. “And I.” “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.” “I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly. “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and ev- ery precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously com- promise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.” “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging ﬁgure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. “If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I should be better able to advise you.” The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I am the King. Why should I at- tempt to conceal it?” 5“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and heredi- tary King of Bohemia.” “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not conﬁde it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.” “Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more. “The facts are brieﬂy these: Some ﬁve years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquain- tance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.” “Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” mur- mured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all para- graphs concerning men and things, so that it was difﬁcult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea ﬁshes. “Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858 . Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of War- saw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.” “Precisely so. But how—” “Was there a secret marriage?” “None.” “No legal papers or certiﬁcates?” “None.” “Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authentic- ity?” “There is the writing.” “Pooh, pooh! Forgery.” “My private note-paper.” “Stolen.”“My own seal.” “Imitated.” “My photograph.” “Bought.” “We were both in the photograph.” “Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.” “I was mad—insane.” “You have compromised yourself seriously.” “I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.” “It must be recovered.” “We have tried and failed.” “Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.” “She will not sell.” “Stolen, then.” “Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.” “No sign of it?” “Absolutely none.” Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little prob- lem,” said he. “But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully. “Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?” “To ruin me.” “But how?” “I am about to be married.” “So I have heard.” “To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.” “And Irene Adler?” “Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.” “You are sure that she has not sent it yet?” “I am sure.” 6“And why?” “Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.” “Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?” “Certainly. You will ﬁnd me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.” “Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.” “Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.” “Then, as to money?” “You have carte blanche.” “Absolutely?” “I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.”“And for present expenses?” The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. “There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said. Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. “And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked. “Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.” Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the photograph a cabinet?” “It was.” “Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.” CHAPTER II. At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady in- formed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the ﬁre, however, with the intention of awaiting him, how- ever long he might be. I was already deeply inter- ested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. In- deed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextrica- ble mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before the door opened,and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side- whiskered, with an inﬂamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in ﬁve minutes tweed- suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the ﬁre and laughed heartily for some minutes. “Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair. “What is it?” “It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.” “I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.” 7“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the ﬂoor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach- house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. “I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two ﬁlls of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.” “And what of Irene Adler?” I asked. “Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at ﬁve every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Sel- dom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a conﬁdant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign. “This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keep- ing. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to thegentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the ﬁeld of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difﬁculties, if you are to understand the situation.” “I am following you closely,” I answered. “I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gen- tleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home. “He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more ﬂurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘ﬁrst to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’ “Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. “ ‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ “This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could ob- ject. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twenty-ﬁve minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind. “My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a sur- pliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating 8with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me. “ ‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’ “ ‘What then?’ I asked. “ ‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’ “I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling re- sponses which were whispered in my ear, and vouch- ing for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spin- ster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.” “This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?” “Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate de- parture, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive out in the park at ﬁve as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.” “Which are?” “Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.” “I shall be delighted.” “You don’t mind breaking the law?” “Not in the least.” “Nor running a chance of arrest?” “Not in a good cause.”“Oh, the cause is excellent!” “Then I am your man.” “I was sure that I might rely on you.” “But what is it you wish?” “When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly ﬁve now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.” “And what then?” “You must leave that to me. I have already ar- ranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?” “I am to be neutral?” “To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or ﬁve minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.” “Yes.” “You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.” “Yes.” “And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of ﬁre. You quite follow me?” “Entirely.” “It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, ﬁtted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is conﬁned to that. When you raise your cry of ﬁre, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?” “I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of ﬁre, and to wait you at the corner of the street.” “Precisely.” “Then you may entirely rely on me.” “That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.” 9He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympa- thetic smile, and general look of peering and benevo- lent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a ﬁne actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime. It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ suc- cinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors- grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were ﬂirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths. “You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather sim- pliﬁes matters. The photograph becomes a double- edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Nor- ton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is—Where are we to ﬁnd the photograph?” “Where, indeed?” “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.” “Where, then?” “Her banker or her lawyer. There is that dou- ble possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardian- ship, but she could not tell what indirect or political inﬂuence might be brought to bear upon a businessman. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.” “But it has twice been burgled.” “Pshaw! They did not know how to look.” “But how will you look?” “I will not look.” “What then?” “I will get her to show me.” “But she will refuse.” “She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.” As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a car- riage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loaﬁng men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A ﬁerce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of ﬂushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their ﬁsts and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direc- tion and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scufﬂe without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb ﬁgure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. “Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several voices. “No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.” “He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!” 10Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. Af- ter all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another. Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the sig- nal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing ﬁgures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shout- ing crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to ﬁnd my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of up- roar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road. “You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been better. It is all right.” “You have the photograph?” “I know where it is.” “And how did you ﬁnd out?” “She showed me, as I told you she would.” “I am still in the dark.” “I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laugh- ing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.” “I guessed as much.” “Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward,fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.” “That also I could fathom.” “Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting- room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was de- termined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.” “How did that help you?” “It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on ﬁre, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of ﬁre was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, es- caped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.” “And now?” I asked. “Our quest is practically ﬁnished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may ﬁnd neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.” “And when will you call?” “At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear ﬁeld. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.” 11We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said: “Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.” There were several people on the pavement at thetime, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. “I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, star- ing down the dimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.” CHAPTER III. I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. “You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sher- lock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.” “But you have hopes?” “I have hopes.” “Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.” “No, my brougham is waiting.” “Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge. “Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes. “Married! When?” “Yesterday.” “But to whom?” “To an English lawyer named Norton.” “But she could not love him.” “I am in hopes that she does.” “And why in hopes?” “Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty’s plan.” “It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an el- derly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she. “I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze. “Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5.15train from Charing Cross for the Continent.” “What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?” “Never to return.” “And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.” “We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her ﬂight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The pho- tograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way: 12“My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes : “You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of ﬁre, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I be- gan to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I be- came suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed. “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an ob- ject of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sher- lock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband. “We both thought the best resource was ﬂight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will ﬁnd the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the pho- tograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard my- self, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a pho- tograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, — “Very truly yours, “Irene Norton , n´ee Adler .”“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?” “From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more suc- cessful conclusion.” “On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the ﬁre.” “I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.” “I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his ﬁnger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. “Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,” said Holmes. “You have but to name it.” “This photograph!” The King stared at him in amazement. “Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.” “I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers. And that was how a great scandal threatened to af- fect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of thewoman.

In my book, Creating Affluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities,  I have outlined the steps to wealth consciousness based on a true understanding of the workingsof nature. The Seven Spiritual Laws of  Success form the essence of this teaching. When this knowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited wealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour. Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres- sive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a more spiritual approach to success and to affluence, which is the abundant flow of all goodthings to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmonywith nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love. There are many aspects to success; material wealth is only one component. Moreover, success is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be one of those things that makes the journey more enjoyable. But success also includes goodhealth, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional andpsychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind. Even with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the seeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in embryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the experience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception ofdivinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive  in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of aflower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expressionof divinity  not occasionally, but all the time  then we will know the true meaning of success. Before defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; its the process by which the observerbecomes the observed; its the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; its the processthrough which the dreamer manifests the dream. All of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest transforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our physical body, the physical universe  anything and everything that we can perceive throughour senses  is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,known, and visible. The physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience Itself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes through which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself asthe objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life. The source of all creation is divinity (or the spirit); the process of creation is divinity in motion (or the mind); and the object of creation is the physical universe (which includes the physical body).These three components of reality  spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of observing, and the observed  are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same place: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest. The physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or consciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anythingwe want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,or a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires. Now lets go over The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  and see how we can apply them in our lives.1 The law of pure potentialityThe source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. And when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power that manifests everything in the universe. In the beginning there was neither existence nor non-existence, All this world was unmanifest energy . . . The One breathed, without breath, by Its own power Nothing else was there . . .  Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda The first spiritual law of success is the Law of Pure Potentiality.  This law is based on the fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousnessis pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con- sciousness is our spiritual essence. Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy. Other attributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility, simplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality. When you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in that knowing itself is  the ability to fulfill any dream you have, because you are the eternal possibility, the immeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The Law of Pure Potentiality  could also be called the Law of Unity,  because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all- pervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of purepotentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you areto the field of pure potentiality. The experience of the Self, or self-referral, means that our internal reference point is our own spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral. In object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations, circumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval ofothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is thereforefear-based. In object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for external power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external power are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,or the power of the Self, or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an absence of fear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or externalpower. In object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, becauseit lives in fear. Your true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is ^completely free of those things. It is immune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is also humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the sameSelf, the same spirit in different disguises.The law of pure potentiality ¶7Thats the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you experience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and feels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power. Power based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts only as long as the object of reference is there. If you have a certain title  if youre thepresident of the country or the chairman of a corporation  or if you have a lot of money, thepower you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only last as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the power. Self-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the Self. And there are certain characteristics of self-power. It draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people, situations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws of nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state ofgrace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond withyou. Your power is that of bonding  a bonding that comes from true love. How can we apply the Law of Pure Potentiality, the field of all possibilities, to our lives? If you want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the creativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One wayto access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spendingtime in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,freedom, and bliss. Practicing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply Be. Experiencing silence means periodically withdrawing from the activity of speech. It also means periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-dio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, thiscreates turbulence in your internal dialogue. Set aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com- mitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if that seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence foran extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week. What happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue becomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. Ive known people who go absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of silence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with theexperience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.This is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around andaround if you  the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker  are not going to speak, period. Then, as the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience the stillness of the field of pure potentiality. Practicing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the Law of Pure Potentiality.  Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi- tate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita- tion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of pure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimateground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶8In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire,  you will see how you can intro- duce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about spontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for manifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentialitythat can orchestrate an infinity of details for you. Imagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while, when the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. Thats exactly what you do when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even the faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, whichconnects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-ness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,and you wouldnt notice a thing. In the Bible is the expression, Be still, and know that I am God. This can only be accomplished through meditation. Another way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg- ment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When youare constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in yourinternal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of pure potentiality. You literally squeeze the gap between thoughts. The gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware- ness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.And when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentialityand infinite creativity. There is a prayer in A Course in Miracles that states, Today I shall judge nothing that occurs. Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your day with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each timeyou catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,then you may simply say to yourself, For the next two hours, I wont judge anything, or Forthe next hour, I will experience non-judgment. Then you can extend it gradually. Through silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first law, the Law of Pure Potentiality.  Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component to this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spendingtime in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces oflife, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain, a lake, or the seashore, that connection with natures intelligence will also help you access the field of pure potentiality. You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment. Access to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be- cause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you haveguilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections ofguilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or successwill solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true healing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self  when you really understand your true nature  you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, oraffluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realize that the essence of all materialwealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.9 The law of pure potentiality¶As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive creative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and pure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, You need not leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.You need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freelyoffer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet. The affluence of the universe  the lavish display and abundance of the universe  is an expression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the more you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond theturbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creativemind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying thestillness of the eternal, unbounded, creative mind. This exquisite combination of silent, un- bounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of stillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence ofopposites  stillness and dynamism at the same time  makes you independent of situations,circumstances, people, and things. When you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself with the world of energy  the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of the material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.And yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent. Stillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a certain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you tounleash your creativity in all directions  wherever the power of your attention takes you. Wherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you. Then the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir ofcreativity, the field of pure potentiality. APPLYING THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITY I will put the Law of Pure Potentiality  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent, to just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately thirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening. (2) I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli- gence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to thesound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy ofmy own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity. (3) I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs, and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶102 The Law of GivingThe universe operates through dynamic ex- change... giving and receiving are different aspects of the flow of energy in the universe. And in our willingness to give that which we seek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu- lating in our lives. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of areed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy infinite gifts come to me only on those very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.  Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali The second spiritual law of success is the Law of Giving. This law could also be called the Law of Giving and Receiving,  because the universe operates through dynamic exchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with the body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; yourenergy is an expression of cosmic energy. The flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces in your life operates as the Law of Giving.  Because your body and your mind and the universe are in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping theflow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That iswhy you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence  or anything you want inlife  circulating in your life. The word affluence comes from the root word affluere, which means to flow to. The word affluence means to flow in abundance. Money is really a symbol of the life energy weexchange and the life energy we use as a result of the service we provide to the universe.Another word for money is currency, which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. Theword currency comes from the Latin word currere which means to run or to flow. Therefore, if we stop the circulation of money  if our only intention is to hold on to our money and hoard it  since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives aswell. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like ariver, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-gle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital. Every relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en- genders giving. What goes up must come down; what goes out must come back. In reality,receiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of theflow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with naturesintelligence. In every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it must give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows intomaterial manifestation.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶12The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the universe circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is given. That which doesnt multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If, through the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given andwill not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving. It is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The intention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is life-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro- portional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of givinghas to be joyful  the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the very act of  giving. Then the energy behind the giving increases many times over. Practicing the Law of Giving  is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if you want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention and appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. Infact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principleworks equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessedwith all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life. Even the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer  has the power to affect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle ofenergy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles ofconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word consciousness implies more than just energyand information  it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore weare bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform. Life is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of impulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and theuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind. When you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with an exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life. The best way to put the Law of Giving  into operation  to start the whole process of circulation  is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you willgive them something. It doesnt have to be in the form of material things; it could be a flower, acompliment, or a prayer. In fact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The giftsof caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you can give, and they dont cost you anything. When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness, joy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful. One of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go to anyones house without bringing something  never visit anyone without bringing them a gift. You may say, How can I give to others when at the moment I dont have enough myself? You can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something aboutyour feelings for the person youre visiting. You can bring a compliment. You can bring aprayer. Make a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as youre giving, you will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous effects of this law. And as you receive more, your ability to give more will also increase. Our true nature is one of affluence and abundance; we are naturally affluent because nature supports every need and desire. We lack nothing, because our essential nature is one of pure13 The law of Giving¶potentiality and infinite possibilities. Therefore, you must know that you are already inherently affluent, no matter how much or how little money you have, because the source of all wealth is the field of pure potentiality  it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need, including joy, love, laughter, peace, harmony, and knowledge. If you seek these things first not only for yourself, but for others  all else will come to you spontaneously. APPLYING THE LAW OF GIVING I will put the Law of  Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift may be a compliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come intocontact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth and affluence inmy life and in the lives of others. (2) Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts of nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers or the first snow of winter. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer. (3) I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving lifes most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Eachtime I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶143 The law of karma or cause and effectEvery action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind . . . what we sow is what we reap. And when we choose actions that bring happi- ness and success to others, the fruit of our karma is happiness and success. Karma is the eternal assertion of human free- dom. . . . Our thoughts, our words, and deeds arethe threads of the net which we throw around our- selves.  Swami Vivekananda The third spiritual law of success is the Law of Karma.  Karma is both action and the consequence of that action; it is cause and effect simultaneously, because every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. There is nothing unfamiliar about the Law of  Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, What you sow is what you reap. Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow theseeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making. You and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are in that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these choices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-stand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices wemake in every moment. Whether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the choices youve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and therefore we dont think they are choices  and yet, they are. If I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to pay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. Butthink about it: its still a choice. I could offend you and I could insult you, and you could make the choice of not being offended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter you either. In other words, most of us  even though we are infinite choice-makers  have become bundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstancesinto predictable outcomes of behaviour. These conditioned reflexes are like Pavlovian condi- tioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time you ring a bell, soon the dog starts to salivate when you just ring the bell, because it hasassociated one stimulus with the other. Most of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the stimuli in our environment. Our reactions seem to be automatically triggered by people and circumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of our existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously. If you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those choices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconsciousThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶16realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is very empowering. When you make any choice  any choice at all  you can ask yourself two things: First of all, What are the consequences of this choice that Im making? In your heart you will immedi-ately know what these are. Secondly, Will this choice that Im making now bring happiness tome and to those around me? If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answeris no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then dont make that choice. Its as simple as that. There is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will create happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,it will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous rightaction is the right action at the right moment. Its the right response to every situation as it happens. Its the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action. There is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane- ously correct choices. The mechanism has to do with sensations in your body. Your bodyexperiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation ofdiscomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask your body, If I make this choice, what happens? If your body sends a message of comfort, thats the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then its not the appropriatechoice. For some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus, but for most people its in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart andask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response  a physical response in the form of a sensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling  but its there, in your body. Only the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti- mental. But its not. The heart is intuitive; its holistic, its contextual, its relational. It doesnthave a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer  the field of pure potentiality,pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power  and takes everything into account. At times it may not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and far more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought. You can use the Law of Karma  to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good things to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your futureis generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a regular basis, then you are making full use of the Law of Karma.  The more you bring your choices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices whichare spontaneously correct  both for you and those around you. What about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can do about past karma. One is to pay your karmic debts. Most people choose to do that  unconsciously, of course. This may be a choice you make, also. Sometimes theres a lot of suffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the Law of Karma  says no debt in the universe ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everythingis a constant to and fro exchange of energy. The second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable experience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as youre paying your karmic debt, What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is themessage that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellowhuman beings?17 The law of Carma or Cause and Effect¶By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity with your dharma,  with your purpose in life, which well talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law of Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression. For example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, What can I learn from this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me? Perhaps the mes-sage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.And if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings? you may decide to share what you learned by writing a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support thatprevents the kind of injury you experienced. This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a benefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into a positive experience. You havent really gotten rid of your kar ma, but you are able to take a karmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it. The third way to deal with karma is to transcend it. To transcend karma is to become independent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, theSpirit. Its like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you take away a few stains. You keep washing it again and again, and each time it gets a little cleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming outagain. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation. All actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action generates memory, and memory has the ability or the potentiality to generate desire. Anddesire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and desire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire. By becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator ofreality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-tionary for you and for those that are around you. And thats all you need to do. As long as karma is evolutionary  for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self  then the fruit of karma will be happiness and success. APPLYING THE LAW OF KARMA OR CAUSE AND EFFECT I will put the Law of Karma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of these choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present. (2) Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself two questions: What are the conse- quences of this choice that Im making? and Will this choice bring fulfillment andhappiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice? (3) I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If thechoice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and for all those around me.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶184 The law of least effortNature 5 intelligence functions with effortless ease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love. And when we harness the forces of harmony, joy, and love, we create success and good fortune with effortless ease. An integral being knows without going, sees without looking, and accomplishes without doing.  Lao T ZU The fourth spiritual law of success is the Law of Least Effort.  This law is based on the fact that natures intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned carefulness. This is the principle of least action, of no resistance. This is, therefore, the principle of harmony and love. When we learn this lesson from nature, we easily fulfill ourdesires. If you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesnt try to grow, it just grows. Fish dont try to swim, they just swim. Flowers dont try to bloom, they bloom. Birds dont try to fly, they fly. This is their intrinsic nture. The earth doesnt try to spinon its own axis; it is the nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle throughspace. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the natureof the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into physical form, easily and effortlessly. In Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of economy of effort, or do less and accomplish more. Ultimately you come to the state whereyou do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and thenthe manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a miracle isactually an expression of the Law of Least Effort. Natures intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it is intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you areestablished in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the Law of Least Effort. Least effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held together by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you wasteenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing theillusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money forpersonal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expressionof natures intelligence. But when your actions are motivated by love, there is no waste ofenergy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,including unlimited wealth. You can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate, store, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-cient way, then you can create any amount of wealth. Attention to the ego consumes thegreatest amount of energy. When your internal reference point is the ego, when you seekpower and control over other people or seek approval from others, you spend energy in awasteful way. When that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you want. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and unfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the experience of affluence and evolution.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶20In The Art of Dreaming,  Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, . . . most of our energy goes into upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two extraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main- tain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energyto catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe. There are three components to the Law of Least Effort   three things you can do to put this principle of do less and accomplish more into action. The first component is acceptance.Acceptance simply means that you make a commitment: Today I will accept people, situa-tions, circumstances, and events as they occur. This means I will know that this moment is as it should be,  because the whole universe is as it should be. This moment  the one youre experiencing right now  is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in thepast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is. When you struggle against this moment, youre actually struggling against the entire uni- verse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the wholeuniverse by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your acceptance  of this moment is total and complete. You accept things as they are, not as you wish they were in this moment. This is important to understand. You can wish for things in the future to be different, but in this moment you have to accept things as they are. When you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not reacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.These are your feelings, and your feelings are not someone elses fault. When you recognize and understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and tochange it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for yoursituation and for all the events you see as problems. This leads us to the second component of the Law of Least Effort:  responsibility. What does responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-tion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-bility then means the ability  to have a creative response to the situation as it is now.  All prob- lems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment andtransform it to a better situation or thing. Once you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the creation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will becomeyour teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, youwill have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve. Whenever confronted by a tyrant, tormentor, teacher, friend, or foe (they all mean the same thing) remind yourself, This moment is as it should be. Whatever relationships you haveattracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your ownevolution. The third component of the Law of Least Effort  is defencelessness, which means that your awareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince orpersuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, youll see that theyspend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish theneed to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormousamounts of energy that have been previously wasted. When you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo- ment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you forcethe situation, the resistance will only increase. You dont want to stand rigid like a tall oak thatcracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends withthe storm and survives. Completely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point to defend, you do not allow the birth of an argument. If you do this consistently  if you stop fighting and21 The law of least effort ¶resisting  you will fully experience the present, which is a gift. Someone once told me, The past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That is why this moment is called the present. If you embrace the present and become one with it, and merge with it, you will experience a fire, a glow, a sparkle of ecstasy throbbing in every living sentient being. As you begin toexperience this exultation of spirit in everything that is alive, as you become intimate with it, joywill be born within you, and you will drop the terrible burdens and encumbrances of defensive- ness, resentment, and hurtfulness. Only then will you become light-hearted, carefree, joyous, and free. In this joyful, simple freedom, you will know without any doubt in your heart that what you want is available to you whenever you want it, because your want will be from the level ofhappiness, not from the level of anxiety or fear. You do not need to justify; simply declare your intent to yourself, and you will experience fulfillment, delight, joy, freedom, and autonomy in every moment of your life. Make a commitment to follow the path of no resistance. This is the path through which natures intelligence unfolds spontaneously, without friction or effort. When you have the exqui-site combination of acceptance, responsibility, and defenselessness, you will experience life flowing with effortless ease. When you remain open to all points of view  not rigidly attached to only one  your dreams and desires will flow with natures desires. Then you can release your intentions, with-out attachment, and just wait for the appropriate season for your desires to blossom into reality.You can be sure that when the season is right, your desires will manifest. This is the Law of Least Effort. APPLYING THE LAW OF LEAST EFFORT I will put the Law of Least Effort  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) I will practice Acceptance.  Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be,  because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they arethis moment, not as I wish they were. (2) Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility  for my situation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaminganyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that everyproblem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit. (3) Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness.  I will relinquish the need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others toaccept my point of view. I will remain open to all points of view and not be rigidlyattached to any one of them.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶225 THE LAW  of INTENTION  and DESIREInherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. . . intention and desire in the field of pure potentiality have infinite organiz-ing power. And when we introduce an intention in the fer- tile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite organiyng power to work for us. In the beginning there was desire, which was the first seed of mind; sages, having meditated in their hearts, have discovered by their wisdom the connection of the existent with the non-existent.  The Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda The fifth spiritual law of success is the Law of Intention and Desire.  This law is based on the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. In fact, at thelevel of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy and information. The quantum field is just another label for the field of pure consciousness or pure potentiality. And this quantum field is influenced by intention and desire. Lets examine this process in detail. A flower, a rainbow, a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their essential components, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essential nature,is the movement  of energy and information. The only difference between you and a tree is the informational and energy content of your respective bodies. On the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the same recycled elements: mostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements in minute amounts. You could buy these elements in a hardware store for a couple of dollars. The difference, therefore, be-tween you and the tree is not the carbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and thetree are constantly exchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real differencebetween the two of you is in the energy and in the information. In the scheme of nature, you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that is capable of becoming aware of  the energy and informational content of that localized field that gives rise to our physical body. We  experience  this field subjectively as our own thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, and beliefs. This same field is experi-enced objectively as the physical body  and through the physical body, we experience this field as the world. But its all the same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, I am that, you are that, all this is that, and thats all there is. Your body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantum mechanical levels there are no well-defined edges. You are like a wiggle, a wave, a fluctuation, a convolu-tion, a whirlpool, a localized disturbance in the larger quantum field. The larger quantum field  the universe  is your extended body. Not only is the human nervous system capable of becoming aware of the information and energy of its own quantum field, but because human consciousness is infinitely flexible throughthis wonderful nervous system, you are able to consciously change the informational contentthat gives rise to your physical body. You can consciously change the energy and informational content or your own quantum mechanical body, and therefore influence the energy and infor-The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶24mational content of your extended body  your environment, your world  and cause things to manifest in it. This conscious change is brought about by the two qualities inherent in consciousness: attention and intention. Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put yourattention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from willwither, disintegrate, and disappear. Intention, on the other hand, triggers transformation ofenergy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment. The quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws ofsuccess. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.Infinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all atthe same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass, in every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive. In the scheme of nature, everything correlates and connects with everything else. The groundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migratein a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony isbeing silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation. The human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human body is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell isdoing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,and monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlationis part of its information field. What is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command this infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed or locked into a rigid network of energy and information. It has infinite flexibility. In otherwords, as long as you do not violate the other laws of nature, through your intent you canliterally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires. You can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You can go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing the intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation. Intention lays the groundwork for the effortless, spontaneous, frictionless flow of pure potentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is thatyou use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in alignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. Intention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is desire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most peopleis attention with attachment. Intent is desire with strict adherence to all the other laws, butparticularly the Law of Detachment,  which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success. Intention combined with detachment leads to life-centered, present-moment awareness. And when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Y our intent  is for the future, but your attention  is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present, then your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. Youmust accept the present as is. Accept the present and intend the future. The future is something you can always create through detached intention, but you should never struggle against the present.25 The law of Intention and Desire¶The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection, memory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement of thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is aware- ness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is aneternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat,electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. Theyjust are. Our interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena and form. Remembered interpretations of abstract forces create the experience of the past,anticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualitiesof attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, thenaction in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future. Intention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the right mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire. If you have life-centered, present-moment awareness, then the imaginary obstacles  which are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles  disintegrate and disappear. Theremaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through one-pointed intention. One-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose. One-pointed intention means holding your attention to the intended outcome with such un-bending purpose that you absolutely refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate thefocused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles fromyour consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to your goal with intense passion. This is the power of detached awareness and one-pointed, focused intention simultaneously. Learn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can still get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,and the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow- ing five steps in the Law of  Intention and Desire.  When you follow these five steps for fulfilling your desires, intention generates its own power: (1) Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts, to go into the silence  that level of Being which is your essential state. (2) Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are actually in the gap, theres no thought, theres no intention, but as you come out of the gap  at that junction between the gap and a thought  you introduce the intention.If you have a series of goals, you can write them down, and have your intentionfocused on them before you go into the gap. If you want a successful career, forexample, you go into the gap with that intention, and the intention will already be there as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the gap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting themto bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desiresto see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.You simply want to release them. (3) Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of your true Self  your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It alsoThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶26means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourself to be influenced by the opinions and criticisms of others. A helpful way to maintain that state of self-referral is to keep your desires to yourself; do not share them with anyone else unless they share the exact same desires that you have and are closely bondedwith you. (4) Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. This means giving up your rigid attach- ment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. It means enjoyingevery moment in the journey of your life, even if you dont know the outcome. (5) Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions and desires, when released in the gap, have infinite organizing power. Trust that infinite organizing power of intention to orchestrate all the details for you. Remember that your true nature is one of pure spirit. Carry the consciousness of your spirit wherever you go, gently release your desires, and the universe will handle the details for you. APPLYING THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIRE I will put the Law of Intention and Desire  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me wherever I go. I will look at this list before I go into my silence and meditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning. (2) I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things dont seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic planhas designs for me much grander than even those that I have conceived. (3) I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in thepresent moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.27 The law of Intention and Desire¶6 THE LAW  of DETACHMENTIn detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty, in the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from our past, from the known, which is the prison ofpast conditioning. And in our willingness to step into the unknown, the field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the universe. Like two golden birds perched on the selfsame tree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell in the same body. The former eats the sweet and sour fruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in detachment.  The Mundaka Upanishad The sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment.  The Law of Detachment says that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquishyour attachment to it. This doesnt mean you give up the intention to create your desire. You dont give up the intention, and you dont give up the desire. You give up your attachment to the result. This a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result, combining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that whichyou desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment isbased on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self. Attachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity  and the need for security is based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in thephysical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everythingelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they comeand go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it ends up making you feel hollow and empty inside, because you exchange your Self for the symbols of your Self. Attachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols. Detachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-dom to create. Only from detached involvement can one have joy and laughter. Then the symbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris- oners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, andseriousness  the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-ness. True wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and with least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want. People are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a very ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, WhenI have X million dollars, then Ill be secure. Then Ill be financially independent and I will retire. Then I will do all the things I really want to do. But it never happens  never  happens.29 The law of pure Detachment¶Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and ephemeral, because security can never come from money alone. Attachment to money will always create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the people who have the most money are the most insecure. The search for security is an illusion. In ancient wisdom traditions, the solution to this whole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means thatthe search for security and certainty is actually an attachment  to the known. And whats the known? The known is our past. The known is nothing other than the prison of past con- ditioning. Theres no evolution in that  absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,there is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer- tainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the field of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations. Without uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. Youbecome the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday. Relinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the field of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom of uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite- ment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life  the magic, the celebration, theexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit. Every day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities. When you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path  so dont give it up. You dontneed to have a complete and rigid idea of what youll be doing next week or next year, because if you have a very clear idea of whats going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then you shut out a whole range of possibilities. One characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches- trate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when youare attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea- tivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire from that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the wholeprocess of creation. The Law of Detachment  does not interfere with the Law of  Intention and Desire   with goal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal. However, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored in, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find somethingmore exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stayalert to opportunities. The Law of Detachment  accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand this law, you dont feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems, you only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and youwitness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaosand the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting. This state of alertness  your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty  meets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity. Whats the opportunity? Its contained within every problem that you have in your life. Every single prob-lem that you have in your life is the seed of an opportunity for some greater benefit. Once youThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶30have that perception, you open up to a whole range of possibilities  and this keeps the mystery, the wonder, the excitement, the adventure alive. You can look at every problem you have in your life as an opportunity for some greater benefit. You can stay alert to opportunities by being grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty.When your preparedness meets opportunity, the solution will spontaneously appear. What comes out of that is often called good luck. Good luck is nothing but preparedness and opportunity coming together. When the two are mixed together with an alert witnessing of the chaos, a solution emerges that will be of evolutionary benefit to you and to all those that you come into contact with. This is the perfect recipe for success, and it is based on the Law of Detachment. APPLYING THE LAW OF DETACHMENT I will put the Law of Detachment  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) Today I will commit myself to detachment. 1 will allow myself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participatein everything with detached involvement. (2) Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the prob-lem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be,the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security. (3) I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibili-ties, I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life.31 The law of Detachment¶7 The law of dharma or purpose in lifeEveryone has a purpose in life ... a unique gift or special talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique talent with ser- vice to others, we experience the ecstasy and exulta- tion of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals. When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.And what is it to work with love . It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. . . .  Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet The seventh spiritual law of success is the Law of Dharma.  Dharma is a Sanskrit word that means purpose in life. The Law of Dharma  says that we have taken manifes tation in physical form to fulfill a purpose. The field of pure potentiality is divinity in its essence, and the divine takes human form to fulfill a purpose. According to this law, you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. There is something that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world  and for every uniquetalent and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs arematched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence.Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance. If you could start children right from the beginning with this thought, youd see the effect it has on their lives. In fact, I did this with my own children. Again and again, I told them there was a reason why they were here, and they had to find out what that reason was for themselves.From the age of four years, they heard  this. I also taught them to meditate when they were about the same age, and I told them, I never, ever want you to worry about making a living. Ifyoure unable to make a living when you grow up, Ill provide for you, so dont worry about that. I dont want you to focus on doing well in school. I dont want you to focus on getting the best grades or going to the best colleges. What I really want you to focus on is asking yourself howyou can serve humanity, and asking yourself what your unique talents are. Because you have aunique talent that no one else has, and you have a special way of expressing that talent, and noone else has it. They ended up going to the best schools, getting the best grades, and even in college, they are unique in that they are financially self-sufficient, because they are focused on what they are here to give.  This then, is the Law of Dharma. There are three components to the Law of Dharma.  The first component says that each of us is here to discover our true Self, to find out on our own that our true Self is spiritual, thatessentially we are spiritual beings that have taken manifestation in physical form. Were not human beings that have occasional spiritual experiences  its the other way around: were spiritual beings that have occasional human experiences. Each of us is here to discover our higher self or our spiritual self. Thats the first fulfillment of the Law of Dharma.  We must find out for ourself that inside us is a god or goddess in embryo that wants to be born so that we can express our divinity. The second component of the Law of Dharma  is to express our unique talents. The Law of Dharma says that every human being has a unique talent. You have a talent that is unique in its33 The law of Dharme or purpose in life¶expression, so unique that theres no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that expression of that talent. This means that theres one thing you can do, and one way of doing it, that is better than anyone else on this entire planet. When youre doing that one thing, you lose track of time. When youre expressing that one unique talent that you possess  or morethan one unique talent in many cases  the expression of that talent takes you into timelessawareness. The third component of the Law of Dharma  is service to humanity  to serve your fellow human beings and to ask yourself the questions, How can I help? How can I help all those that I come into contact with? When you combine the ability to express your unique talent withservice to humanity, then you make full use of the Law of Dharma.  And coupled with the experience of your own spirituality, the field of pure potentiality, there is no way you will not have access to unlimited abundance, because that is the real way abundance is achieved. This is not a temporary abundance; its permanent, because of your unique talent, your way of expressing it, and your service and dedication to your fellow human beings, which youdiscover through asking the question, How can I help? instead of Whats in it for me? The question, Whats in it for me? is the internal dialogue of the ego. Asking How can I help? is the internal dialogue of the spirit. The spirit is that domain of your awareness where you experience your universality. In just shifting your internal dialogue from Whats in it for me? to How can I help? you automatically go beyond the ego into the domain of your spirit.While meditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simply shifting yourinternal dialogue to How can I help? will also access the spirit, that domain of your awarenesswhere you experience your universality. If you want to make maximum use of the Law of Dharma,  then you have to make several commitments. The first commitment is: I am going to seek my higher self, which is beyond my ego, through spiritual practice. The second commitment is: I am going to discover my unique talents, and finding my unique talents, I am going to enjoy myself, because the process of enjoyment occurs when I go into timeless awareness. Thats when I am in a state of bliss. The third commitment is: I am going to ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity. I am going to answer that question and then put it into practice. I am going to use my uniquetalents to serve the needs of my fellow human beings  I will match those needs to my desire tohelp and serve others. Sit down and make a list of the answers to these two questions: Ask yourself, if money was no concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do? If you wouldstill do what you currently do, then you are in dharma, because you have passion  for what you do  you are expressing your unique talents. Then ask yourself: How am I best suited to servehumanity? Answer that question, and put it into practice. Discover your divinity, find your unique talent, serve humanity with it, and you can gener- ate all the wealth that you want. When your creative expressions match the needs of your fellowhumans, then wealth will spontaneously flow from the unmanifest into the manifest, from therealm of the spirit to the world of form. You will begin to experience your life as a miraculousexpression of divinity  not just occasionally, but all the time. And you will know true joy and the true meaning of success  the ecstasy and exultation of your own spirit.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶34APPLYING THE LAW OF DHARMA OR PURPOSE IN LIFE I will put the Law ofDharma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps: (1) Today I will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryo that lies deep within my soul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animates both my body and mymind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the con- sciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience. (2) I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while expressing my unique talents. When 1 express my unique talents and use them in the service of humanity, I lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as inthe lives of others. (3) I will ask myself daily, How can I serve? and How can I help? The answers to these questions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION I want to know Gods thoughts... the rest are details.  Albert Einstein The universal mind choreographs everything that is happening in billions of galaxies with elegant precision and unfaltering intelligence. Its intelligence is ultimate and supreme, and itpermeates every fiber of existence: from the smallest to the largest, from the atom to the cosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper- ates through The Seven Spiritual Laws. If you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres- sion of these laws. Every cell, whether its a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has itsbirth in the Law of Pure Potentiality.  DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is the material expression  of pure potentiality. The same DNA existing in every cell expresses itself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell. Each cell also operates through the Law of Giving. A cell is alive and healthy when it is in a state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,but it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell, and in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the flow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only bymaintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence. The Law of Karma  is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is the most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs. The Law of Least Effort  is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job with quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.35 The law of purpose ¶Through the Law of Intention and Desire,  every intention of every cell harnesses the infi- nite organizing power of natures intelligence. Even a simple intention such as metabolizing a molecule of sugar immediately sets off a symphony of events in the body where precise amounts of hormones have to be secreted at precise moments to convert this molecule of sugar into purecreative energy. Of course, every cell expresses the Law of Detachment.  It is detached from the outcome of its intentions. It doesnt stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered, present-moment awareness. Each cell also expresses the Law of Dharma.  Each cell must discover its own source, the higher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomachcells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. Andbecause they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents with effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they maintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body. The internal dialogue ofevery cell in the human body is, How can I help? The heart cells want to help the immunecells, the immune cells want to help the stomach and lung cells, and the brain cells are listeningto and helping every other cell. Every cell in the human body has only one function: to help every other cell. By looking at the behaviour of the cells of our own body, we can observe the most extraor- dinary and efficient expression of The Seven Spiritual Laws. This is the genius of naturesintelligence. These are the thoughts of God  the rest are details. The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  are powerful principles that will enable you to attain self-mastery. If you put your attention on these laws and practice the steps outlined in this book, you will see that you can manifest anything you want  all the affluence, money, and success that you desire. You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,for these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile. There is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help you to remember them. The Law of Pure Potentiality  is experienced through silence, through meditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the Law of  Giving. The principle here is to learn to give that which you seek. Thats how you activate the Law of Pure Potentiality. If you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money, give money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,and affection. Through your actions in the Law of  Giving you activate the Law of Karma.  You create good karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you dont have toexpend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of theLaw of Least Effort.  When everything is easy and effortless, and your desires keep getting fulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the Law of Intention and Desire.  Fulfilling your desires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the Law of Detachment. Finally, as you begin to understand all the above laws, you begin to focus on your true purpose in life, which leads to the Law of Dharma.  Through the use of this law, by expressing your unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whateveryou want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an expression of unbounded love. We are travellers on a cosmic journey  star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. But the expressions of life are ephemeral, momentary,The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶36transient. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, This existence of ours is as transient as autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at the  move- ments of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of  lightning in the sky, Rushing by like a torrent down a steep  mountain. We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is a precious moment, but it is transient. It is a little parenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring,lightheart-edness, and love, we will create abundance and joy for each other. And then this moment will have been worthwhile. * * *37 The law of purpose ¶Deepak Chopra is a world-renowned leader in the field of mind-body medicine and human potential.
